My name is Jack Mitchener and I am a Math-Computer Science student. I currently am waiting to hear back from law schools that I applied to back in October. So far I have heard back from UCLA and was admitted! I am very excited about this and am hoping to hear back more good news in the next couple months. My goal is to become an intellectual property or patent lawyer in the future. I want to develop a strong background in Computer Science so I can be the best lawyer possible for Software Engineers and other developers when they are trying to protect their products.
