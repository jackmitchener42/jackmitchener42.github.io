## Jack Mitchener
I am a **Math-Computer Science** student. I currently am waiting to hear back from law schools that I applied to back in October. So far I have heard back from UCLA and was admitted! I am very excited about this and am hoping to hear back more good news in the next couple months. My goal is to become an  _intellectual property_  or  _patent lawyer_  in the future. I want to develop a strong background in Computer Science so I can be the best lawyer possible for Software Engineers and other developers when they are trying to protect their products. 

My favorite quote from the tv show _Community_  is from Abed:
> Some flies are too awesome for the wall.
